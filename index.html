			DisagreEeable
		</h2>
		<p>
			DisagreEeable is the latest in a centuries-old line of upstart music journals intending to upset the mainstream and propagate good taste. Founded in early 2022 by Jonah Dayley, and published on the web later that year. Currently rapidly expanding in profile and stature, with circulation doubling each month.
		</p>
		<p>
			Here is the back archive of our reviews. Currently, DisagreEeable is not structured as a website, a consistent blog, but more of a digitized copy of the in-person zine. Each issue ill be uploaded and viewable as a PDF, for the time being.
